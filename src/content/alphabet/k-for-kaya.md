## Kaya Toast

Kaya toast is a staple breakfast item in Singapore,
and it's super simple to make:

**Butter first...**

Toast the slice of bread, and while it is still hot,
spread a thick layer of butter on it.

**... then the kaya**

Next a thin layer of kaya.
Do this quickly, before the butter melts into the bread,
so that the kaya and the butter mix - yum!

**Enjoy!**

Best served with Milo/ Kopi/ Teh!
