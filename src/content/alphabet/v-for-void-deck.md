Void deck is the empty ground floor of a HDB block.

In primary school, everyday also after school I play football with my class in void deck.

## Void decks, then and now

Previously void decks contained nothing but lift entrances, structural pillars,
and nothing else - hence the name.
Sometimes there were some concrete table & stools too,
and if your were really lucky a Mama shop.

Nowadays, the new HDB blocks come with neighbourhood RCs,
kindergartencentres, childcare centres, etc,
occupying a lot of the ground floor;
but we still call them void decks!
