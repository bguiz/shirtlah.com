What makes us Singaporean?

Is it that we know how say "We the citizens...", or how to sing "Majulah Singapurah"?

Is it that they guys do two years of National Service after finishing school?

Kena tekan for two years leh!{{% /speech-bubble %}}


Is it because we were born in the country, or belong to a certain set of races?

Perhaps those things do, and perhaps they don't.

What certainly does is what we all experienced while growing up and living here. Hearing the MRT announcement in four languages. Reading the *PETS* English textbook in primary school, where every single story represented each of the four races. Playing soccer with a tennis ball in a HDB void deck. Eating ice-cream in a sandwich made with rainbow-coloured bread. Studying like crazy for exams because your parents were kiasu, and it was your duty to *save face* for them. Going for night cycling expeditions which were just excuses for eating lots of prata and drinking milo dinosaurs.

Each of these, by itself, does not mean much. But there is one thing that gels all of them together. The meta-experience of being Singaporean: and that's Singlish.

It really has been around - you're either speaking it or listening to it - when any of these things happen. Singlish just has a way of permeating all the experiences of living and growing up in Singapore.

Almost every sentence contains words from at least two languages, sometimes three, and sometimes even more. And that isn't even counting the dialects. We speak it fluently without even understanding how difficult this would be for anyone else.
