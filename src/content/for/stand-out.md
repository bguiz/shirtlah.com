Picture this:  You're walking down the Orchard road,
or walking through void decks in your HDB estate.

You look around you, and everyone around you is wearing T-shirts with the same ol' slogans and designs.

Eh, actually ah, I got this shirt. It say Singapore is a fine city.{{% /speech-bubble %}}

Yeah, but *Singapore is a fine city* is a T-shirt about Singapore, about what foreigners think about our country. Not exactly a T-shirt about what Singaporeans think about Singapore.

Ya lor, I wear cos bo pian no other shirts about Singapore. So I suck thumb and wear.{{% /speech-bubble %}}

You're belting out the dance moves in Zouk on Mambo night,
or downing a pint over live music at Timbre,
or eating palak mutton until gelat at Al Ameen at Bencoolen.

Again, you look around you, and notice everyone with the same boring shirts as before. You're wondering, why no-one is wearing T-shirts with Singlish - or anything to do with Singapore - on them.

Simi!? That was last time lor. Now different oreddy! Now shiok oreddy!{{% /speech-bubble %}}

Now you have got something everyone else does not. You're wearing a Shirt Lah! Your shirt has got a uniquely SIngaporean flair, your shirt  has got Singlish on it.

Now everyone is looking at you â€¦ and you know what they are thinking.
