Many many people have been to Singapore - [54 million per year](http://www.changiairportgroup.com/cag/html/the-group/air_traffic_statistics.html) - but most of them don't step out of the airport. Those who do come into Singapore they have a great time, but one thing perplexes them, and that's the language.

Ha! Tourist come, hear hear Singlish, then blur like *sotong*!

At first they hate it, and then later they come to love it.

Then, it is time to leave. That means time to get a souvenir to remember their travels. What do they get?

Keychain, fridge magnet, shot glass lah!

Memorabilia depicting various landmarks in Singapore are *passable* souvenirs. Not very exciting, not particularly interesting though.

How about one that just hits the spot? How about getting something that captures your experience in Singapore, and captures he essence of talking with Singaporeans?
