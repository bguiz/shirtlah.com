Do you dream of speaking Singlish everywhere, including at work?
Do you ever find yourself switching to "proper English" at work,
and wish that everyone else would just speak "proper Singlish" instead?

Well, guess what? You're not the only one. Almost everyone else is thinking the same thing too! You should speak Singlish, at home, at the office, wherever and whenever you feel like it! You should be able to show off your cultural identity with pride!

But how to liddat? If I speak Singlish, macham my colleagues think I bodoh. Then how? Kena trap leh?

That's why in Singapore, the country which invented Singlish, where most people speak Singlish at home, instead of English, everyone is begrudgingly compelled to speak English, in formal settings.

We have spent our first fifty years as a nation treating Singlish as the inferior cousin of English. Let's not continue to do so, for paying cultural deference like so makes us second class citizens in our own country.

Eh, your Engrish dam cheem leh. You got answer or not?

It is perfectly fine that you have not shown your identity at work yet. It is totally cool that you have not worked up the courage to take the first step. We're going to make that first step much much easier for you!

Speaking Singlish does not have any bearing on your IQ, but it does have everything to do with your culture and identity. Why not kill two birds with one stone, by wearing witty Singlish T-shirts to work?

Wah! Shiok ah! Got wear so many Engrish T-shirt oreddy liao, but never wear Singlish T-shirt before

We'll make the T-shirts, all you have to do is wear them. It's subtle, it's witty, and it's a sure-fire conversation starter. It'll be the thin end of the wedge that gets Singlish back in your office!
