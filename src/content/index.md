Do you love to speak **Singlish**?

Do you find yourself "getting" jokes that only a Singlish speaker would get?

You're not the only one!

**Fact**: Pick an English joke/ pop-culture reference/ whatever,
and there's a T-shirt somewhere out there, with that printed on it...

... but Singlish on a T-shirt - now, that's hard to find.
It's like all the jokes went to a party together,
but the Singlish ones never got the invite.
