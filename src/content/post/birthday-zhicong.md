Just a quick note from us here at the Shirt Lah! team...

Zhi Cong has been hard at work these past few weeks
sourcing for T-shirt suppliers and printers,
squeezing every bit of free time he has after a full day's work of swim coaching
in order to bring all of us T-shirts that will be *shiok* to wear.

We're taking a short break to wish him happy birthday!
