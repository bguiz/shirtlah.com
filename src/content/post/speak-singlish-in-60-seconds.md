Never got to learn Singlish in school? Well here's your chance!

Even if you went to school in Singapore, where everyone speaks Singlish,
you never would have gotten a proper lesson, with a proper exam.

### Answers

{{% text-bubble speaker="limpeh" pointer="right" %}}
Dun cheat ah! Finish the questions first, then see the answers.
{{% /text-bubble %}}

(1) The answer is *B* “Ramu got 5 apples **meh?**”

Because Ramu has 2 + 3 - 1 - 1 = 3 apples. Since he has 3 apples, you are rejecting the statement that he has 5 apples, therefore **meh?** is appropriate here, because you are questioning it.

(2) The answers are **in bold** in the full passage below:

> Siti asks Ramu for 1 apple **back**. Ramu say **cannot**. Siti **ask** why **cannot**.
>
> Ramu says "**Wa lao** eh, why you **liddat**? Just now you gimme, then now you want **back**. You super **bo liao** leh!"
>
> Siti says "I dun like this cloze passage. My **PETS** text book everything **also got** happy ending"
