Hi everyone, we're Zhi Cong, Elizabeth, & Brendan
- the team bringing you **Shirt Lah!** -
and we wanna tell you the story of how we started:

<!--more-->

It all started when Zhi Cong & Brendan realised that so many people around us were wearing T-shirts from the **same few brands** (such as Threadless). Many times we have thought:

{{% text-bubble type="thought" pointer="left" %}}
I have that shirt at home, lucky never wear today, otherwise damn **malu**!
{{% /text-bubble %}}

After that, it occurred to us so many Singaporeans were wearing shirts that have **nothing to do with us**, nothing to do with Singapore? Almost everyone here speaks **Singlish**, but we have hardly seen anyone wearing a T-shirt with Singlish on it - it's always just English.

Wa lao eh, boring sia.

Why are there no shirts for Singlish fans?

So we decided to fix it. We'll make our own!
Brendan sketched the first set of designs,
in a notebook while sitting on an MRT ...

Off-peak time, MRT akcherlee can sit down one!

... then took a picture of it,
and *Whatsapp-ed* it to Zhi Cong.
We met later that afternoon (at Bishan S11),
and the conversation literally went like this:

{{% text-bubble speaker="brendan" pointer="left" %}}
Cong ah, the designs can or not?
{{% /text-bubble %}}
{{% text-bubble speaker="zhicong" pointer="right" %}}
The ideas can, but your drawing ah, CMI!
{{% /text-bubble %}}
{{% text-bubble speaker="brendan" pointer="left" %}}
Yalah, yalah, I know - we need to find a real artist!
{{% /text-bubble %}}

The same week, Zhi Cong found Elizabeth.
She has this awesome skill
where you can describe any scene from life in Singapore,
and she can **capture the moment** perfectly.
So we asked her to join us, and Shirt Lah! was born!

Personal **intro's** from each of us:

- Zhi Cong (coming soon!)
- Elizabeth (coming soon!)
- Brendan (coming soon!)

If you love **Singlish**, and wear **T-shirts**:
Shirt Lah! gives you the **2-in-1** you want!
